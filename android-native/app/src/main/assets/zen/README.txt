Place licensed zen loop files here for Android playback.

Expected filenames:
- calm.mp3
- focus.mp3
- night.mp3

Notes:
- The Android app loads these from assets/zen/*.mp3 and crossfades when switching.
- If files are missing, it falls back to placeholder tone ambience so the app still works.
- Use small looping MP3s for beta builds.
