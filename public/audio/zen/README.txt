Place licensed zen loop files here for web playback.

Expected filenames:
- calm.mp3
- focus.mp3
- night.mp3

Notes:
- Keep loops seamless if possible.
- Aim for small compressed files (e.g., 128-192 kbps MP3) for fast load.
- The app will crossfade between tracks.
- If files are missing, the app falls back to placeholder synth ambience.
